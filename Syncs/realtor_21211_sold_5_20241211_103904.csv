The upper level houses 2 beautiful bedrooms and a reading area/ office bathed in natural light pouring in through skylights. Restored transoms above the bedroom doors allow the natural light to spill in and fill the bedrooms with sunshine. People, Pets, and Plants will all thrive in this sunny little enclave.
